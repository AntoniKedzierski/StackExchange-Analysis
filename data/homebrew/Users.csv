I began my professional career at sixteen as a technical support consultant for America Online (AOL). My success in this role led to two excellent project management internships with AOL, one in Arizona and one at AOL Corporate Headquarters in Virginia. I enjoyed these internships so much that I began my collegiate journey convinced that I wanted to be a project manager working on software development projects. As the dot-com bubble burst I took an undergraduate internship with Sandia National Laboratories assisting with processes in their Computer Support Unit.</p>

<p>As an intern at Sandia opportunities kept arising for small programming tasks which refocused my university coursework on programming. As I took more programming classes, I began to look for opportunities at Sandia that would help enhance and develop my programming skills. When I started my master’s degree, I started a new Sandia internship developing small application components of a corporate application used to store information about computers, networks, and computer accounts. After earning my master’s degree from the Anderson Schools at the University of New Mexico I accepted a position as a member of Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories.</p>

<p>Once hired as a permanent member of staff my responsibilities rapidly increased from the design and implementation of small application components to large corporate application architecture, design and implementation. It was during the development of one such large application that I became acutely aware that my knowledge of software development could be improved. This realization led me on a journey of self-teaching, which while adequate in some ways, left me with the desire to learn much more regarding the intricacies of software engineering and led to my enrollment at Carnegie Mellon to earn a Master’s of Science in Software Engineering.</p>

<p>Sandia allowed me to apply the knowledge acquired at Carnegie Mellon by reshaping the way my team develops software. Over the course of a year I reshaped our haphazard development processes into the practices of Extreme Programming. During the first year utilizing this new methodology the team designed, developed and released four enterprise scale projects.</p>

<p>Professional success influenced by practical academics has shaped my outlook on software development. I have never stopped learning and am always interested in refining my development processes. For me it is not just the programming, all aspects of software development excite me.</p>

I'm keen to learn C# and the .Net framework in the near future. I'm happy to work with html and XML, and I typeset the vast majority of my university work using LaTeX.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'm a keen photographer. I'm a Canon user, shooting with a 5D. I'm interested in landscapes and cityscapes, as well as bits of sports photography. I'm wanting to learn more about how I can use flash to enhance my photos.</p>

<p>I am a developer working in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-mvc"">ASP.NET MVC</a> from the early CTPs through to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-core"">ASP.NET Core</a>.</p>

<p>I work in both VB.NET and C#, but also write a lot of scripts in Powershell which I have become increasingly enamoured by due to some of the language features introduced in later versions.</p>

<p>I originally started professional software development using ASP.NET (webforms). I then switched jobs and worked almost exclusively in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coldfusion"">ColdFusion</a>. It gave me the chance to get to know MVC a lot more through the <a href=""https://github.com/Mach-II/Mach-II-Framework"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mach-II</a> framework - an implementation of MVC for Coldfusion. When ASP.NET MVC came out, convinced our employers to migrate due to a wider availability of software engineers (it was incredibly difficult to get good ColdFusion developers!). When it came to picking up ASP.NET MVC, I felt I had a much stronger advantage than if I had continued using 'classic' ASP.NET webforms.</p>

<p>I answered more questions in the first two months on here, than I did in five years at <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=experts+exchange+scam"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Experts Exchange</a>, and I enjoy the fact that stackoverflow is more community based.</p>

<p>Initially spurred on by the challenge of ""doing better than <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/261677/jonathon-bolster"">Jonathon Bolster</a>"", I found that helping out is extremely enjoyable and helping people of all technical skill levels is great fun.</p>

<p>Long ago, I left home and joined the <a href=""http://www.marines.mil/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">United States Marine Corps</a> where I was assigned the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of Basic Metal Worker (MOS 1316). I loved building things as a welder, but could not see myself doing this until I reached age 65.</p>
<p>After my Honorable Discharge in the early 1990s, I used my G.I. Bill to go to school and received my Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics four years later.</p>
<p>Using a love of computers since I played on a Commodore 64 at 10 years old and two (2) C++ electives that I had taken in school, I began working in the computer programming field.</p>
<p>The recession following ENRON in 2001 left me working at a remedial job for a little over two years while I brushed up on my skills at a local community college in SQL and first learned what the new .NET Framework was all about.</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of working as a Software Developer since 2003.</p>
<p>For a short while, I pulled in a little extra income by running a moonlighting business under the name <a href=""http://www.joeswelding.biz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Joe's Welding</a>. Dangerous working conditions and non-paying customers prompted me to sell my mobile welding equipment about the time my son was born.</p>
<p>Today, I am exclusively a Software Developer. My language of choice is C#, and I enjoy working with databases.</p>

</p><p>
If I down-voted your answer, it was because it was either just wrong, or more often, because you failed to read the question. e.g., Q: ""I need a way to share files... I don't think I want Subversion..."" Your answer: ""Use subversion(link)"". Or you just posted the first link from Google, without any explanation.

I am sure, if you talked to my wife, she would have many things to say about me. For now, I will just tell you I live in Idaho (or close to it). I have the most beautiful wife in the world and I feel like God took pity on me when we got married. I honestly have no idea how she fell in love with a nerd like me. We bought our first home about three years ago. We have two dogs (you can find them on Dogbook, which is right below this). My beautiful wife works as an English teacher. She currently teaches 10th graders. I, on the other hand, work for a company that manufactures wine storage tanks. I am mostly an engineer for them, but also help with orders during the busy season. I enjoy mowing the lawn and taking out the trash in the summer and shoveling the walk in the winter. I occasionally make ""not so sweet"" things out of wood. My family would call me a computer nerd, but I probably know about as much as you do, I just tend to amaze the people that don't know much. I am sure, if I thought hard enough, I could think of something else, but I think I am going to stop now.</p>

I have been working full-time as a software engineer since I graduated from college in 2005. I began coding when I was 13, and I have loved it ever since. My main interest area is information security – or <em>cyber</em> if you prefer – and in addition to writing security software for a long time, I have also done some penetration testing work. In the last three years, I have been working as a contractor on a DARPA R&amp;D contract involving web crawling, dark web, and machine learning.</p>

<p>My main strength is developing web applications in high-level languages – Python is my favorite – but I consider myself more of a general hacker who is comfortable working with a wide range of technologies and learning whatever I need to accomplish the task at hand. (I suppose that <em>full-stack</em> is the trendy term.) In my study of infosec, I have spent a lot of time learning to read assembly and reverse engineer applications to develop exploits. (I have the OSCP, CISSP, and CEH certifications.)</p>

<p>I have released a couple of work projects as open source. I created an easy-to-use web crawler called <a href=""https://gitlab.com/hyperion-gray/starbelly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Starbelly</a>, as well as a database migrations system called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/agnostic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Agnostic</a>. And if you want to get really nerdy with me, I wrote a tiny utility called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sshadduser"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sshadduser</code></a> that simplifies the error-prone process of giving somebody SSH access to a server. I also like writing and teaching. In addition to developing infosec courses for government clients, I also participate here on Stack Overflow and infrequently publish on <a href=""https://markhaa.se"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my tech blog</a>.</p>

<p>I have been working full-time remote for several years now out of my home office in the Washington DC area. I am seeking contract work (1099) for 2018.</p>

By trade, I'm a software engineer, specializing in web applications of late, and learning about Android and iOS app development in the almost non-existent time between projects. I have training in human-computer interaction and human factors, and have an excellent eye when it comes to end-user experience.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like to hang out with my 2-year-old daughter, brew beer, study philosophy, cook, and read about the Hapsburg dynasty. When it comes to food and drink, I'm just as fascinated by the chemistry as I am with the taste. I'm a man of faith, science, and very bad humor. My favorite place in the world is probably the Umbrian countryside in Italy -- between the food, wine, and beautiful towns with architecture that dates back to the middle ages and are still alive and bustling, the place brings me joy.</p>

I have been tinkering with code since childhood on a Commodore 64 (Snoopy versus the Red Baron was hard…until you changed the game!) and continued on later in school writing LPC code for a <a href=""http://aldebaran.mud.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">MUD</a>. I began my undergraduate studies in Electronics Engineering but my frustration with analog signal processing spurred my jump to Computer Engineering for which I earned my B.S. Being outside the classroom for a couple years was a challenge so I went back (virtually) and earned my M.S. in Computer Information Systems a couple years later.</p>

<p>Over the last decade I’ve been focusing mostly on the Microsoft stack. Professionally I started with some maintenance of VB6 ASP applications, grew into ASP.NET applications up through InfoPath and SharePoint 2007, SharePoint Workflows and now Silverlight 4 with WCF services riding on SharePoint. I’m an Apple fan too with almost my entire computer infrastructure at home consisting of Macs with the occasional Windows or Ubuntu box.</p>

<p>My passion for programming is only rivaled by my interest in foreign languages and customs. As a big scifi watching, fantasy reading, code-dreams having engineer I often find human interaction puzzling. I think this is what drives my interest in the diversity of personalities and cultures across the globe. To date I speak a few languages and can be pleasant and ask for help in a dozen or so more. The most satisfying part of language learning is spotting intercultural influence and verifying your hypothesis and learning even more in the process.</p>

<p>I would love to travel more and visit the places about which I’ve studied and I hope to eventually have that mobility. First up: <a href=""http://www.visitnorway.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">Norway</a>!</p>

I have always been a hobbyist, and thought I would try out my hand in home brewing ""Since I do have a passion for beer, but not a lot of cash. Seemed like a bad idea not to try it."" For my first attempt, I created beer from stale bread and tea. Though successful, I used an entire packet of baking yeast ""I know better now. Most people only use that much for much much higher quantities, and baking yeast is not particularly what people use for most brews."" So I decided to use a small amount of it for a starter of my next batch, which is a full gallon. I am still in the trial and error process of just making a beer that is successfully carbonated and fermented out of ingredients I have lying around the house, that doesn't taste like cat throw up ""Not that I'd know what it tastes like :-p..."" My expectations aren't very high for a great beer from cheap ingredients, but if anyone has any pointers on how I can make it better, or have made a decent beer (Or another type of brew) from such ingredients, let me know. I do plan to start brewing with actual kits in the near future after we buy a house and settle in, so the road is only starting with the bread experimentation.</p>

<p>superuser:  I got an Apple IIe at about 10 years of age. I became a computer gamer. Then you needed to know how to wiggle, jiggle, manipulate, and navigate all around a computer (at least software side) to get it to do what you wanted. I was motivated to learn and worked long and hard at it. Now, like many of you I am sure, I am the the go-to guy when it comes to fixing, tweaking, or simply using the potential of friends and neighbors computers.</p>

<p>Role-Playing Games: GMed on and off over the years. Mostly off for the past 10 years or so. Starting things back up. Have started to formalize my last campaign in a wiki and am resurrecting it as I type! Thus I am here to seek the insight and experiences of others.</p>

My career started by following these passions in a development role. I moved into leadership about nine years ago because I wanted to build something bigger than I could build on my own. My current role has allowed me to form and grow DevOps, Security Engineering, and UX teams while architecting a clean-sheet PaaS-based SaaS product. I don't believe in perfect stacks; technology choices should fit the people doing the work - amplifying strengths and hiding weakness. A trusting, honest, diverse team can solve any problem when given the leeway to do so. Growing &amp; challenging those teams is what I love most about my work.</p>

<p>Ph.D. in genetics, where I specialized in ant population genetics. Published software as part of my dissertation (R and python).
From there, I went on to Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), where I served as a bioinformaticist, analyzing large genomic and transcriptomic datasets (using mostly R) for clients.
I then attended Epicodus, a rigorous six-month software development trade school in Portland, OR to learn how to code the ""right"" way (javaScript, Angular, JAVA, Android).</p>

<p>I have since returned to biology as an instructor at Portland Community College and Clark College in Portland, OR and Vancouver, WA, respectively. But, I still code whenever I can (see active github page linked to the right), including during teaching holidays as a contractor with a local wildlife computer vision non-profit called WildMe.</p>

<p>Recent coding projects include an Angular webapp. called, Population Fragmentation Simulator, which simulates a metapopulation experiencing a phenomenon called genetic drift (<a href=""https://www.populationsimulator.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.populationsimulator.com</a>) (Angular, hosted using several AWS services). This project was accepted by the peer-reviewd Journal of Open Source Education in November, 2019 (<a href=""https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00070"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00070</a>).</p>

<p>Another recent passion project is called Match Annotator, which is an Angular webapp. that allows users to submit and annotate brazilian jiu jitsu (bjj) matches in order to crowd-curate vital and missing bjj performance data. This project is the first in which I have attempted to have extensive integration testing coverage (Cypress) and CI (with CircleCI).</p>

<p>I am very data-oriented and keen in particular on tool-making for other users, whether they are students, jiu jitsu practitioners/sports nerds, RuPaul's Drag Race fantasy league entrants, or other biologists.</p>

<p>Learn almost anything for free.</p>

<p>If you have any skill and like to teach, trust me, someone is wanting to learn from you right now, and in many cases, even willing to pay for it.</p>

<p>Last 1.9 year I made over 4565000rs./ $83,000 US selling one course alone (This One). In this course you'll learn with all detail exactly how I made that happen so you can do the same.</p>

<p>I have decided to make this training FREE. So All curious and skilled people can be trainer and say entrepreneur and make money and fame like khan academy, lynda.com, Pinal dave, www.hanselman.com  .Why I do charity because now I am satisfied with this amount of money. and I am planning to make new trainings to sale. </p>

<p>I will teach you how to create your own online course, make it look awesome, promote it, sell it, and make money with it.
Sounds good? </p>

<p>well here is exactly what we will cover:</p>

<p>Getting started: how to break down your course, all the tools you can use to create a course, and how to make it interesting so people actually listen!</p>

<p>Creating a great course: I'll teach you how to create a super cool presentation using Keynote</p>

<p>Recording your course: once you create your presentation you need to record it. I'll teach you how to use ScreenFlow for Mac to record your computer screen and yourself and how to edit it all together.</p>

<p>How to promote your course: once you have created your course it is time world know it exists! I'll teach you the most efficient ways to promote your course and find students.</p>

<p>Making money selling your course: how much to charge for your course? I'll teach you how to create a great sales page for your course, how to use PayPal to make money selling your course, finding affiliates, and much more!
Just like you I have invested zillions of dollars and many years educating myself, learning new skills. It's time to share that hard earned knowledge with the world and creating an online course is one of the best ways to do so, reach thousands of people and why not make some money on the side.</p>

<p>Are you ready? Let's do it!</p>

I’m Kevin Kinnett, and I’m a technologist and software developer living in the Atlanta area.
</p>

<p>
My interest in software development began when I was young, sitting in front of the family’s Intel 386 at the age of eleven, learning how to program with QBasic. Later I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Kennesaw State University where I also served as the President of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Presidential Fellow, and worked as Student Technology Advisor.
</p>

<p>
In my time as a professional developer, I’ve worked with a wide breadth of technologies. But over the last 10 year I’ve had a focus on integration using the Microsoft stack, working with SOA architectures using RESTful and other webservices varients, along with several middleware products. These days I am primarily focused on developing solutions using Azure PaaS services.

For me, the constant in this wild and wonderful constellation is an urgent sense of connectedness to and appreciation for the natural world. The knowledge that mountains, rivers, valleys, fjords, glaciers, and even beaches (yes, I like to unwind with some mindless lounging occasionally) await my light and respectful footprints whets my appetite for more every single day.</p>

<p>I worked at vivint.smart.home on streety.</p>

<p>I previously was employed by Canonical USA and I work on Juju and things related to www.jujucharms.com.</p>

<p>Before that, I worked at Arbor Networks on things related to ATLAS, which is now decommissioned.</p>

<p>From 1998 to 2008, I wrote custom software solutions for integrating Windows and Unix. My blend of traditional system administration and custom software solutions has allowed numerous enterprises to transcend platform dependence.</p>

<p>I have written software to manage specific applications deployed across hundreds of Unix servers and thousands of Windows servers remotely via a Web Management Interface. The system works without an agent utilizing standard Unix remote management protocols such as SSH.</p>

<p>I've been an independent contractor working on Windows Forms applications for tuning embedded software control modules for a US auto manufacturer.</p>

<p>I spend my free time writing more software, baking, and watching far too much television.</p>

<p>Baking is great. I highly recommend growing your own yeast.</p>

<p>All that is nice, but I should start at the beginning. I was born. I begged to be taught to read, but waited until formal school. Around age 6 - I’m not exactly sure when - I learned TRS-80 compatible basic on a Sharp 1500 (Radio Shack PC2) pocket computer. My parents encouraged this by borrowing a VIC20 from my uncle for a few months before purchasing the family an Atari 800XL for Christmas around the time I was 7 or 8.</p>

<p>Atari 800XL was WAY better than Commodore 64 in the only area that mattered to me: BASIC. I had drawing primitives. LINE, CIRCLE and PAINT functions - or were they called subroutines - were available. I loved me some drawing. In 1987 around the time I turned 10, my family upgraded to a used Amiga 1000, with the 512K option. Thanks to the AmigaBasic 1.2 and 1.3 provided by Microsoft, I was now writing basic without line numbers. This was like QBasic or QuickBasic on a PC available years later. I struggled endless hours trying to make the North C compiler compile my hello world app. I never succeeded.</p>

<p>Age 14 in 1990, Dad buys the family - me - my first “PC”, a 4</p>

<p>Tim is a husband, father, blogger, RPG gamemaster, wargamer, homebrewer, OSS software geek, and independent thinker.</p>

<p>Tim won the <a href=""https://altdorfer.blogspot.com/2011/05/wfrp-best-of-fans-9.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2011 Best of the Fans</a> recognition by <a href=""https://altdorfer.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Altdorf Correspondent</em></a> for his 26 WFRP entries in the Blogging A to Z 2011 web event. He will use ""Award Winning"" from time-to-time to remind you of this recognition. Tim marked five years as participant of the Blogging A to Z web event, collaborating internationally with fans of Warhammer.</p>

<p>Tim's gaming grognard badges include managing an FLGS from 1986-1988, running <em>TMNT:OS</em>, <em>Twilight:2000</em> (being a child of the Cold War) and writing a <em>Twilight:2000</em> chargen in BASIC on a TRS-80 CoCo II, enjoying lots <em>WFRP</em> 1ed and <em>WH40K:Rogue Trader</em> in college, and refereeing a Shadowrun 1ed tournament at the Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1990.</p>

<p>Tim can be found on StackExchange, lurking on <a href=""https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/2670/javafueled"">RPG</a>, <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/users/3467/javafueled"">homebrew</a>, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/289767/javafueled"">stackoverflow</a>, or on <a href=""https://untappd.com/user/javafueled"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Untappd</a> and <a href=""http://github.com/timothystone/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub</a>. Tim also asks that your profile be complete enough that he will be able to know that you like RPGs, OSS, and homebrewing too.</p>

<p>Tim's gaming interests include WFRP 1e and 2e, Twilight:2000, D&amp;D BECMI, 1e and 5e, and some others.</p>

<p>Tim's homebrewing experience is almost 20 years old—he doesn't subtract the 12 idle years between getting married and reigniting his passion in the hobby. He brewed <a href=""https://untappd.com/b/thirsty-stone-brewing-night-gaunt/1023546"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Night Gaunt</a> in 2015 for a local gaming con, uniting two hobbies. Annual batches of Night Gaunt have been brewed since.</p>

<h3>With respect to StackOverflow</h3>

<p>I believe there's great value to short, clear and ""to the point"" answers, telling the user exactly which direction he should be moving. It is okay to add an answer repeating what was already said if it has more concise and better wording. Like with Google Search, think of reducing the time it taskes to get the satisfied reader off the answer page as quickly as possible. </p>

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</pre><br>

<p>My wife and I also make wine with 2013 being a record year of 12 six gallon batches. My wife recently has been on a cider kick, but after finding most of the commercial examples so awful sweet, we have begun to ferment our own, tart/sour versions that are very good.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask me anything.  I have made some excellent beer but only after making just about every mistake in the book and I understand how frustrating it can be to start off with no help.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>At home, when I have some spare time, I also like programming. I tried some Nintendo DS programming in Lua, C, and C++. In the process, I learned (basic) OpenGL and wxWidgets on desktop computers, too. I also used Git, GitHub, and Google Project Hosting for personal projects.</p>

<p>Besides programming and computers, I'm a total music (metal/rock) and movie (fantasy/horror/sci-fi) geek. I like going to live gigs, eating in nice restaurants, and travelling to countries I never visited before.</p>

<p>When <strong>Excel</strong> couldn't do everything I wanted with data, I moved to <strong>Access</strong>, then <strong>VBA</strong> in Access to do even more.</p>

<p>While working IT, got tasked with creating <strong>VB6</strong> app with only VBA knowledge. Check! Wrote VB6 app used by 3000 concurrent users hitting an access database. Stupid, I know, but it taught me how to manage connections, tables and indexes very well.</p>

<p>Moved to another company and had to learn <strong>FoxPro</strong>.  More interesting than you would think!  Convinced them to use <strong>VB.net</strong> and <strong>SQL Server</strong>.  Created my own entity framework and object oriented query language, before MS's entity framework or LINQ was invented, that works for MS SQL, <strong>Oracle</strong> and Access, simply based on the connection string.</p>

<p>Along the way, learned <strong>ASP</strong>, <strong>ASP.net</strong> and eventually turned to <strong>Silverlight</strong> as a way to avoid having to support multiple apps that do the same thing, but in different venues. Ended up writing my own <strong>IsolatedStorage database</strong> to handle the ability for users to disconnect from the server and go in the field without a network connection.</p>

<p>BTW, all along, I still did IT so I setup servers, networks, computers and everything in between.</p>

As a kid I started out with a dialect of LOGO, quickly graduating to a variant of Pascal, both of which I mainly used to make games. Later I taught myself HTML, thinking I was now a certified web developer, as way too many people did at the time (it was about the year 2000). Once I grew up and went to college I learned to properly use languages and environments like Turbo Pascal, Delphi, ASP, PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, C and C++ and I even taught some Java, even though I never learned it before I did. I guess my college had a rather desperate lack of teachers.</p>

<p>School never was my thing, however. My grades were good, but I could never bring myself to completing the menial task of proving that after I had already derived Circle and Square classes off of a Shape class I could really do it again for a Triangle. I ended up with a job where I wrote embedded software for hardware that the company I worked for developed in-house. While a good learning experience, it turned out that this was not my thing and after about a year I was looking for another job. I rolled into the web development business. After 2 relatively short employments I ended up with my current employer where at the time of writing I've happily worked for almost five years and will hopefully continue to work for many more.</p>

<p>I've been responsible for a lot of websites, mainly built on LAMP environments. I also maintain the Android app connected to one of those projects and am slowly rolling into iOS development.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I've been teaching myself C# and XNA4 (even though it's end of life) so I can start creating games again in my spare time. I've also taken on a <a href=""https://github.com/NMe84/Sick-Beard-TPB-A"" rel=""nofollow"">Python project</a> because I was tired of using defective software.</p>

<p>I'm a hobbyist programmer who loves thinking about how systems talk to each other.

I'm an avid consumer of science fiction, with a special soft spot for all things cyberpunk. Oh, and I just recently began reading comics. Better late than never, right? </p>

While working for one of the first ISPs in Columbus, Ohio, in 1995, he built the second major web-based shopping center, Americash Mall, using Cold Fusion and Oracle. Bill’s focus started to turn to security around the turn of the century. Internet-driven viruses were becoming the norm by this time, and applications were susceptible to attack like never before. In 2003, Bill wrote the security and deployment chapters of the often-referenced Professional ASP.NET Web Services for Wrox and began his career in pen testing and threat modeling with a web services analysis for the State of Ohio. Currently, Bill is working as a security-minded software architect specializing in the Microsoft space. He has recently designed a global architecture for a telecommunications web portal, modeled threats for a global travel provider, and provided identity policy and governance for the State of Ohio. In addition, he is actively publishing, with the latest effort being Windows 8 Application Development with HTML5 for Dummies.</p>

<p>I've worked for more than 13 years, designing products for web ventures, from 3-person initiatives to medium-large industry. Strong Presentation and Negotiation Skills have been key to this work (in addition to the full monte; infrastructure, database design, core algorithms, scaling, backed and frontend frameworks, test-ability, compliance, and UI/UX + SEO). </p>

<p>I also design technology &amp; products by drawing from a history of fabrication, prototyping, sourcing, and scientific research (applied physics).  I am a practicing sculptor, and establish new product aesthetics via my own approach to engineering fluid-mechanical processes.  From this work in water, I have built a broad &amp; deep knowledge-base on the application of fluid phenomenon to industry needs.</p>

<p>I have lead successful small-capitalization stages, wrote grants &amp; engaged program officers, developed teams and timelines, design of experiments, measurement, and business development.</p>

  <p>For every natural phenomenon there are different levels of
  explanation. I like to call these ""why"" values. For the first value of
  why, the question ""Why is the sky blue?"" can be answered with some
  simple hand-waving about light from the sun passing through our
  planet's atmosphere. For a value of why + 2 (also known to parents as,
  ""But whyyyyy?"") you have to start talking about the fact that light
  comes in different colors. </p>

<p>In 1975, I attended Washington State University.  While there, I brewed serveral batches of Pale Ale. I got good at it.  One of my hallmates wanted to know how I brewed it.  He watched a couple times and took notes on my methods.  Later on, he took my recipe for English Pale Ale and started Pyramid Brewery and used my recipe for his signature brew.  </p>

They actually wrote me a polite response, which regrettably I lost years ago.  At age 8 I found a kids book about BASIC and took it into ""computer lab"" at school and asked if I could ""try it.""  The teacher didn't know what that meant, and neither did I, so we just had me type some code into our word processor, only to be disappointed when nothing magical happened.  At age 11 I got my first computer, a discarded 386 from the Veteran's Administration where my uncle worked, and began learning C++ from a book.</p>

<p>In 10th grade I took a Pascal class, and in 11th grade AP Computer Science using C++, both classes a year earlier than ""normal.""  For the AP Computer Science test, I opted to take the ""B/C"" version, even though my class only covered the ""A/B"" content, and I scored a 3 out of 5.  In spare time I made a crude wireframe 3D engine using a C++ line-drawing library.  In 12th grade there were no more programming classes left to take, so I was an aide to the AP CS class.</p>

<p>I studied Computer Science at George Mason University and aced such 400-level courses as Artificial Intelligence (Lisp), Computer Vision (Matlab), Algorithms and Data Structures (theory, no coding), and Computer Graphics (OpenGL in Java).</p>

<p>In early 2008 I began working as a Software Systems Developer at Micro Focus.  I worked on native Windows application development using C++ Win32 API/MFC/ATL/COM, Visual Studio IDE integration, a cross-platform XML-processing toolkit using the Apache Xerces-C++ XML parser, extensive test automation using both proprietary tools and open ones (JavaScript/IeUnit, Tcl, CppUnit), and COBOL in a Web application server environment emulating IBM's IMS.</p>

<p>I've been Linux (slackware circa kernel 1.2.8) as my main OS, but gradually used Windows 95 more. Initially did some system admin work in NT4, then went the direction of programming, working mostly in Access 97 (for frontend and backend) for about 2 years. After picking up DB design, moved up to MSSQL 7, with VB6 for a frontend. Designed many classic ASP apps with compiled web class ActiveX DLL's and MSSQL 2000 as the DB server. Picked up MySQL and Oracle. </p>

<p>In 2003, started full time development in VC++ with MFC. Started using subversion in combination with bugzilla for management of off-the-shelf kiosk application. In 2005, started dev in .Net 2.0 with C#. Actively develop company website transaction management in ASP.Net, with MSSQL 2005 backend.</p>

<p>Currently learning EF4 in the hope of porting a VB6 Application using an Access 2000 backend to a .Net 4 application using WPF with the MVVM pattern, and SQLite DB for backend.</p>

<p>I am a Development Manager / Project Manager / Software Architect / Software Engineer with decades of practical experience spanning a wide array of tools, technologies, and industries. I have strong technical skills and am equally comfortable in leadership or technical roles, but I am probably most valuable consulting, planning, and leading projects to successful completion. I am an exceptional problem solver and am great at finding innovative workable solutions to almost any challenge.</p>

<p>If your project is already running smoothly, then congratulations! You probably don’t need me. I am the guy you want when things are turning upside down, heading completely off the rails, and you are starting to pray for a miracle. Well, your prayers are answered. I am here to deliver your miracle—nothing supernatural—just good old-fashioned hard work, commitment, and grit. I am a fixer, a troubleshooter, a hands-on results-oriented manager—that guy you want to come in, take charge, and get the job done no matter what.</p>

<p>I want to take your broken processes, your bug-ridden software, your dysfunctional development team, your late project that just won’t seem to end, your impossible problem no one has been able to solve, or whatever other challenges you are facing, and I want to help you fix them.</p>

<p>I want to take those problems and make them my own—internalize them—obsess over them—grab hold of them with the same tenacity a Pitbull grabs onto the backside of a fresh new mailman. I won’t stop until we get-er-done. </p>

<p>I am a straight-shooting hard-charging high-energy go-getter. I prefer short duration high intensity engagements and thrive in chaotic fast paced environments. </p>

<p>If you are still reading, then it is probably because you’ve already decided I am “the one.” Great! We obviously have a lot of work to do. So, hand me my marching orders, and let’s roll up our sleeves and get started. I am ready to exceed your expectations, deliver concrete results, and turn you into the company hero.</p>

I have an interest in physics as it pertains to applications in engineering (mostly), as well an interest in mathematics as it applies to physics (also mostly).  I've found that it becomes easier to solve specific problems the more I understand the fundamental principles behind them, so my interest does extend somewhat beyond the application both.  It also doesn't hurt that I think they can be pretty fun by themselves.</p>

<p>As it stands now, my focus is probably going to be in electromagnetism, specifically antennas, microwave circuits, and communication systems.  I'm also interested in electronics, but without a stronger background in quantum mechanics (something that I'd love to achieve someday), I don't think that I'd be able to do as well as I'd like in that area.</p>

<p>I believe that science needs good public relations, just like any other social institution.  Scientists have the responsibility to follow the examples of Feynman, Sagan, Nye, and Tyson in the attempt to educate laymen and establish scientific thinking as the cornerstone of common sense.  Excellent spoken and written communication are central to that goal, and scientists/engineers should have a solid education in both.</p>

<p>The two scientists I personally feel the most affinity toward are Paul Dirac and Oliver Heaviside.</p>

<p>I believe that if each of us use our skills, abilities and experience, then together some of the world's big problems can be solved. I’m meaning things like recycling, food waste and disease … the very big problems!</p>

<p>I am a data specialist with 30 years’ experience in providing solutions to business problems, particularly in data strategy, data compliance, data management and analytics. I felt it was time to engage with using these skills to make a difference.</p>

<p>I get a buzz from a business or charity being able to engage with data in a more meaningful way.</p>

<p>In my downtime, I enjoy spending time with my family, in summer chasing hot air balloons, in winter with a good book and single malt. An intermittent gamer, and problem solver on Project Euler.</p>

<p>I'm a senior independent Swift developer. With the platform since ""iPhone OS 3”, and with nine years of professional programming experience (Ruby, Java), I've worked on a diverse portfolio of iOS projects - at least 20 to-date, including several that are well-known: recently a HealthKit app for Philips, and an award winning navigation app for Audi.
Originally from northern England, I’m very mobile and travel a lot, dividing my time between my side- project Tacks and working with clients around the world to bring their ideas to life.</p>

<p><strong>Style</strong> </p>

<p>I invest a tonne of time keeping myself up-to-date, and seek constantly to improve the way I write code, trialling new techniques in my own side-projects.
I use <strong>MVVM</strong> pattern to shrink the size of my ViewControllers, and I mix this with the <strong>Coordinator</strong> pattern to control the navigation and presentation flow. I use <strong>fastlane</strong> to automate building, testing and shipping my code. I use various FRP libraries (<strong>ReactiveCocoa</strong> et al) to enable me to write declarative high-level code and to reduce the complexity of managing state (I gave a talk on this at CocoaHeadsNL in April 2015). I use git (git-flow strategy) continuously to prepare new features. I use <strong>Carthage</strong> to manage dependancies. I unit test and employ TDD (when it's appropriate), to write reliable, well-structured code.</p>

<p>I contribute to open-source projects such as ReactiveKit, please see github.com/iandundas</p>

<p>I also develop research on new projects for professionals and companies, analyzing and testing concepts with Arduino, each day more specialized in AVR and ARM microcontrollers, especially with the line produced by ATMel and STM32</p>

<p><strong>Life Projects</strong></p>

<p>One of the great projects that I have in my life is to work with the social, since accumulating certain knowledge in the technology area, I see that uniting the two fields can bring very interesting benefits for social projects. So I seek in my spare time to also develop my knowledge in this area, acting and contributing as volunteers in social projects.</p>

<p><strong>Social networks</strong></p>

<p>In social networks, my greatest pleasure is to contribute to new communities, especially if I am closely connected to the subject, I am a strong supporter of the Arduino Community in Minas Gerais, I also moderate several groups on [Facebook] (https: // facebook. com / ProfessorCarlosDelfino) and some on [LinkedIn] (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosdelfino"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosdelfino</a>).</p>

I'm proficient in a couple languages; Java, C++, Pascal. I've had a passing experience with countless others (but since I don't actively practice they are now mostly forgotten).</p>

<p>I've been coding since I was a kid - sometimes I do it for ""fun"" (but less and less). My first language was BASIC on an Apple II. Then I was really into ""softcoding"" for text based games (MU*), and then into ""web design"". My first programming class was in highschool; we were taught TurboPascal, followed by VisualBasic. </p>

<p>At university the languages used to teach computer science were C, Java, and Scheme. I also took a CIS course (through the college of business) where I learned some C# (but wasn't too impressed with the program; I would much rather ponder ""what is computable""). </p>

<p>In my brief professional experience I've worked mainly with C++ (Qt) and Delphi to create nice user interfaces. I had a brief experience with LAMP based webapps (and later with Spring 3 MVC). None of that really interests me (but thats what was required).</p>

<p>Currently I'm into Android development - its a hobby. I like to create things. I want those things to be useful. That work is available on fdroid (and the code on github).</p>

<p>I studied at the <a href=""https://scuolasuperiore.uniud.it/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scuola Superiore</a> of the University of Udine.
I've been interested in Computer Science since high school. Being pretty good at school I've enrolled in one of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_Graduate_Schools_in_Italy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schools of Excellence</a> in Italy. In this institution I had the chance to follow many interesting courses not included in the standard CS curriculum: from Bioinformatics to Neural Networks, from Category Theory to Reverse Mathematics, from Logical Frameworks to Statistical Mechanics. During my enrollment I had to keep a very high mark score in my exams and I had periodic evaluation exams that taught me how to work and learn under pressure.</p>

<p>In the last 13 years I've been using quite a bit of <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python</a>, as you can see from my answers. In the last 3 years I have also been interested in functional programming, in particular in <a href=""/questions/tagged/haskell"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;haskell&#39;"" rel=""tag"">haskell</a>, and my Bachelor thesis project involved implementing <em>in</em> Haskell a type inferencer <em>for</em> Haskell inside an already existing research tool.</p>

<p>I have used <a href=""/questions/tagged/java"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;java&#39;"" rel=""tag"">java</a> during my Master thesis where I have implemented some advanced algorithms into an <a href=""http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/tools/plugin/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">existing Eclipse plug-in</a> developed at the University of Edinburgh (my contribution has not been released yet).</p>

<p>Other languages I've used include: <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> (in particular in relation with the <a href=""/questions/tagged/python-c-api"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python-c-api&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python-c-api</a>),<a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/kotlin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kotlin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kotlin</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/go"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;go&#39;"" rel=""tag"">go</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/curry"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;curry&#39;"" rel=""tag"">curry</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/prolog"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;prolog&#39;"" rel=""tag"">prolog</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>.</p>

<p>M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

In 1989 I transitioned into IT and have spent the remainder of my career there.</p>

<p>I've always enjoyed working with microprocessors and software. It is only in the past few years that I've felt the information was now freely available and the cost was within reach. I've purchased Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards and have created many projects with them. I find it enjoyable to share my projects on YouTube. I find inspiration from others' videos and hope mine do the same for others.</p>

I graduated in 2009 from Stevens Institute of Technology with a bachelors and masters of science in Computer Science, a minor in Law &amp; Public Policy, and graduate certificates in Computer Systems, Databases &amp; Service Oriented Architecture, Distributed Systems, Enterprise Computing, Quantitative Software Engineering, and Service Oriented Computing.
<br/><br/>
I got my start programming at a very young age, writing QBasic programs to display colorful circles on the screen while sitting on my dad's lap when I was 3 years old. My first big projects were a Super Mario World clone for GameBoy, a MUD called HybridMOO, and a home automation package called IntellHome (which I still use!).
<br/><br/>
I'm actively involved in a number of open source initiatives, including an open-source middleware tool called PushoverQ.
<br/><br/>
I am interested in hiking, exploration of abandoned or neglected sites and buildings, photography (particularly of those abandoned sites, but also glamour/editorial), cooking, snowshoeing, and New Jersey trivia/history.</p>

<p>I am a Masters stundent in Pure Mathematics at San Diego state. I have completed most of the program with Exactly a 3.00. Faculty did not award me a T.A position. They say it is competitive. I get it. They have people T.A that are in academic probation and probably got kick out the program by now. They also have Germans T.Aing and gettiing the best research. They are so superior in every way. I get it. I am so  dumb.  I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. </p>

<p>SDSU DOES NOT PRODUCE ANY RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS.I have sumbitted applications to PHD programs. Faculty for the most part have not written anything. </p>

<p>I have to work. I manage to find a line cook position. It's like Hell's Kitchen. It is stressfull. The Last thing I want to do is to go back. Hopefully, PHD program says yes. AGAIN, SDSU DOES NOT PRODUCE MATHEMATICAL RESEARCH AND THEY LACK CLASSES, RESOURCES. </p>

<p>Let's say some faculty  is angry at me. I have no problem switching to another program like Applied. I can change levels.</p>

I cook with a spontaneous style that I bring to my brewing. I have been brewing since October 2011, I have made many brews in that time, the one I make most frequently is strawberry lager, I also make peach lager and honey draught a lot. These beers are made by adding either frozen or dried fruit, or 500g of creamed honey to the fresh wort. I have also made several stouts over the years , I have a golden syrup milk stout and a blackberry stout fermenting at present It is summertime right now where I live so I will be putting a few more stouts down while its warm to be ready for our winter. I have found many helpful tips from the internet during the time I have been brewing, I do not know heaps but the little I have learnt I am happy to share, I also look forward to learning from the collective wisdom you all have. I am also lucky that the village I live in has a water supply that comes from a well, so it is ideal for making beer with.</p>

<p>I went to Caltech for Applied physics, and have a great deal of Mechanical Engineering experience (and SolidWorks experience).</p>

<p>I have been using Debian since ""Slink"" was the stable version (1999-ish), and I have been administrating Linux networks since 2004 (fileservers, email, DNS, DHCP, IDS, IPTables, backups, LDAP+Kerberos).</p>

<p>Most of my programming experience is backend, primarily in scientific data analysis &amp; monitoring / automation. I prefer python as a language, but I am not a zealot. I find it is most pragmatic to use the right tool for the right job. I am also very proficient with C/C++ &amp; BASH. Additionally I have experience writing code for clusters using PThreads &amp; OpenMPI. I have a bit of experience implementing TCP servers and clients for custom network applications as well.</p>

<p>My HTML / CSS experience is rather rudimentary. The web stuff I have done has mostly been webapps for internal business processes (Manufacturing, Quality Control, Data Integration, ect). I have done a lot with AJAX as well, though I prefer to use JSON rather than XML unless I really need the power of XML (for example: Defining Document Types, and Validating Documents).</p>

<p>I have used Django on quite a few projects, and I love it!</p>

<ul>
<li>It is really easy to setup.</li>
<li>It follows the MVC paradigm so there is great separation between program logic and the interface which makes Django projects very maintainable.</li>
<li>The built in admin interface saves a lot of time and leaves my clients with a very easy way to update the content of their site without needing to consult me.</li>
<li>I get to write my code in python instead of php!!! This is huge because time spent doing web work is not wasted gaining experience on a language that is a one trick pony!!!</li>
<li>I can use any of the extensive python libraries in my Django projects, which greatly reduces the amount of code that I need to write.</li>
<li>Django apps can be fairly modular (especially if attention is payed to build them that way) which makes them highly reusable in other projects. Think lego bricks...</li>
<li>If I ever hit bottle necks in the performance of python, it is trivial to write python wrappers for optimized C/C++ code (or any other language for that matter), thus allowing the C/C++ code to be used directly from inside Django.</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently do consulting/freelance work in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
<li>Software Engineering</li>
<li>Automation &amp; Monitoring Systems</li>
<li>Fullstack Web Applications</li>
<li>Permaculture Design</li>
<li>Live Bee Removal</li>

I am a jack of many trades and a master at a few, but generally I love learning. I started out as a kid who coded in DOS in the 1980's. My father was a do-it-yourself type person as a mechanic with the mind of an engineer that loved computers.</p>

<p>I got on the track of an environmental scientist in high school and wanted to be a vet-tech, but chemistry thwarted me. So I turned to art, animation, and design. During my college years I learned to code html as a hobby, discovered accessibility needs, and embraced CSS. I became this hybrid of coder and designer.</p>

<p>Now I'm self-learning javascript, as well as keeping myself updated with html5, CSS 3, and accessibility changes. Oh yes... and arting with my kids!! That's the best!</p>

Now I'm looking back into it either as a weekend hobby to keep my mind active and to expand my skills. I'm mildly exploring it as a career switch at the moment.</p>

<p>I have a BA in Philosophy and a MA in Theology from the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. I've spent a number of years doing high school ministry.  I love working with the church and discussing theology, especially theories about biblical development and interpretation.</p>

He has been dissecting electronics and computers since he was a kid -- always ""upgrading"" them, of course. One of his most successful upgrades was turning a 5-speed blender to a 10-speed -- his parents didn't know what to do with him.</p>

<p>Mark began his love for coding in the eighth grade when he received his first C++ compiler. As all the other kids were being gifted games, toys and bikes, Mark received a compiler for his code. He couldn't open it fast enough to write that first program and hasn't stopped writing code ever since that young age.</p>

<p>In 2004, Mark earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from DePaul University. He then continued his education to receive a Master of Science in Management Information Systems in 2008. Working both for himself as a freelancer and advancing his career as a professional, Mark has over 10 years of experience in the field of computer science. He is never shy of taking on new challenges and is always eager to learn the latest in the world of technology.</p>

I enjoy all aspects of software development from writing and maintaining code, to making high-level architectural decisions and engaging in discussions at meetups, in the office and online.</p>

<p>I focus primarily on Android development and have worked professionally for the last four years in the mobile software sector, having worked both in my home country of Ireland and abroad in The Netherlands. I regularly experiment with other technologies such as scripting languages and web development and I am always looking for a new challenge! </p>

<p>In the past I have worked in highly dynamic and self-organising environments where I was required to take initiative but also be in constant communication with the rest of the team so we could stay on track and work cooperatively in the most efficient way. I have had this experience working in both big and small companies, but I am also now getting experience working alone as a freelancer/consultant for local businesses in my hometown. </p>

<p>Ultimately I am a highly motivated and hard working person who craves a challenge and loves to build things with other passionate people, especially as part of a diverse workforce with many different types of people. In previous positions I have felt under challenged and accepted that as part of doing a job, but it would be extremely exciting for me to join a company which gives me as much work and responsibility as I can handle so I can reach my full potential as a software engineer!</p>

I am elated to hold a multi-faceted position at South Brunswick Charter School. I wear many hats at school each day, sometimes quite literally! I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Archaeology from Appalachian State University with a minor in Geography, where I became a member of Lambda Alpha, the National Collegiate Honors Society for Anthropology. I am a proud Odyssey of the Mind Alumnus. I am currently pursuing certification from the Commonwealth Education Trust for a Foundations of Teaching for Learning Specialization (May 2017 Anticipated). From time to time, you might find me in the unconventional role of ""Sausage Professor"" at the Midway Commons Lowes Foods. I am fortunate to live on magnificent Oak Island with the love of my life and my “furchildren”: four dogs and two cats. Never a dull moment; but I would not change it for the world!</p>

<p>In the last decade or so I have managed my own mining and industrial supplies business, operating on a niche consumables market in one of Perth's industrial pocket.</p>

<p>More than a decade of experience in the school of hard knocks as a business owner has given me the experience not taught in business schools.</p>

<p>Multiple economic crises and market busts have shifted my perspective on where my life was heading. It made me realised how much I should have done in life. It prompted me to search for a new direction. The one that would allow me to experience my calling to the full and help fellow business owners.</p>

<p>I found that it is through coaching that I could experience the joy of lifelong learning and lifelong friendship.</p>

I started as a lowly customer service rep but felt inefficiencies everywhere so started to initially build tools in excel using VBA and VLookups.  Then I found myself using Salesforce and administrating that which lead me to want to program using Apex but Apex books seemed to require previous experience in real programming so I bought Java for dummies and read it from cover to cover in a weekend and started trying to code in Apex.  Then I embarked in trying to get my own project going which resulted in me learning angular and node.js... That was a limited path because of the SEO implications so I switched to learning React... Now I am a full stack developer by night and an admin/developer for the Salesforce platform by day.</p>

<p>Nowadays, professionally I'm mainly:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Linux server admin (mostly SUSE - openSUSE and SLES - and some Red Hat - RHEL) of Testing, Development and Production servers (both physical servers and virtual machines - usually VMware) </li>
<li>...and an admin of VMware vSphere ESXi/vCenter Server clusters. So, I work regularly with VMware products, namely vSphere (began on ESX 4.0, now on ESXi 6.0 and vCenter Server 6.0). </li>
</ul>

<p>My laptop and netbook also run Linux (namely Ubuntu).</p>

<p>The coding that I do is mostly in Perl and ""shell scripts"" (for the ""bash"" shell) for automating system administration tasks in Linux servers. In ""previous lives"", I coded web applications in PHP for LAMP based projects and also in ASP (""Active Server Pages""), both ""classic ASP"" - ASP + VBScript - and ASP.Net - using C#</p>

<p><strong>Some of my Certifications:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RHCE</strong> - ""<em>Red Hat Certified Engineer</em>"" (valid, but no longer current since December 2017)</li>
<li><strong>SCE</strong> - ""<em>SUSE Certified Engineer</em>"" in Enterprise Linux 12</li>
<li><strong>LFCE</strong> - ""<em>Linux Foundation Certified Engineer</em>""</li>
<li><strong>RHCSA</strong> - ""<em>Red Hat Certified System Administrator</em>""  (valid, but no longer current since December 2017)</li>
<li><strong>LFCS</strong> - ""<em>Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator</em>""</li>
<li><strong>VCP</strong> - ""<em>VMware Certified Professional</em>"" (""VCP4-DCV"", ""VCP5-DCV"" and ""VCP6-DCV"")</li>
<li><strong>MCP</strong> - ""<em>Microsoft Certified Professional</em>""</li>

<p>I am one of the passionate people about web and mobile programming. I've started learning programming myself through online resources. My heart goes to back-end development because it seems more challenging for me. Still, I love front-end arts other developers and feel amazed about them. I see myself as a developer within 1-2 years working for a company and/or startups, or at least freelancing. </p>

<p>Learning on my own has been tough road and I'd appreciate any kind of help such as apprenticeship or mentorship. I'm ready to join teams to gain knowledge and experience for any amount of compensation you feel right for my current skills.</p>

<p>Happy coding, guys!</p>

I currently am comfortable working in PowerShell and SQL and occasionally dabble in Python. I also learned HTML in college but didn't really enjoy it and no longer see the need for coding in it with today's advances in web developing. I hope to become a Windows-based Systems Administrator or some sort of Security Administrator during my career while working in a corporate environment. I also want to startup my own side business doing networking and hardware solutions and hope to eventually do that full-time (years down the road after I've gathered enough experience and knowledge in the corporate world.) Learning different languages and coding in them is essentially a fun challenge that I can mix in with everything else that I am working towards.</p>

<p>I am an experienced data scientist, currently working for a pension fund where our &quot;innovation&quot; team supports both the pension administration (automatic data anonymisation, mail classification, process automation, fraud detection) and the investment branch (portfolio optimisation, prediction, text mining, document search).</p>
<p>We bring a product from intake to production, involving: defining a project with the business, choosing the technology and designing the software architecture, processing and loading the data, applying the appropriate statistics or machine learning, and finally making data available with an API and frontend to be deployed in the cloud. This is great fun!</p>
<p><strong>Biophysics</strong></p>
<p>I have also spent 13 years in academia doing biophysics research, teaching, and supervising MSc and PhD students. I have taught statistics, computer programming, thermodynamics and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. In my research I used spectroscopy (lasers, magnetic fields and radio waves) and computer simulations to study the structure and interactions of biological molecules. Our aim was to better understand how new types of antibiotics work, to support rational design of improved new compounds. This was pretty cool stuff but I liked the data-analysis most so I became a data scientist.</p>

A strong dislike of front-end code helped Marlon to delve deeper and understand better the inner workings of server side code and interpreters, but also exposes him to challenging problems of todays scalable systems. A programmer that maintains a balance between real life and tech, making time to squeeze in entomology, photography and trying to be a weekend farmer - while still getting good week-night hack sessions in. Loving Linux and FreeBSD, but enjoying the strengths of Microsoft systems for stuff like game dev. Thrives in an adult, respectful and tech-savvy workplace, a rarity.</p>

<p>now instead of having an input image synthesize and output audio write a new golang server to implement the reverse of above system namely have this second server input audio to synthesize and output image</p>
<p>so first server does :  imageA --&gt; audioA
second server does :  audioB -&gt; imageB</p>
<p>when I was able to tie those system together such that the audioA output of first server was used as input audioB of second server and the output imageB matched the original input imageA I knew the system worked ...  I have this all working ... next step is to production size this and make available to the blind ( it may allow the blind to see with their ears ) ... and visa versa for the deaf ... also looking into other uses</p>

I always find myself digging deeper into electronics, computers, Mac OS and music. Im a big fan and constant learner of my tripple boot hackintosh running Ubuntu, Windows 10, and Mac OS. I'm enthralled by operating systems and spend much of my time tinkering and hacking (white hat) them. I like to pretend it's the 90's and we are still in the heyday of understanding how computers can work better, and that real DJ's still exist. Call me a tinkerer.</p>

It allows you to embed security into your end-to-end SDLC process, and it teaches your teams how to design, develop, and implement secure code. Many developers don’t know what secure code looks like, and many more aren’t fully aware of the more than 1,000 categories of security mistakes that developers can make.</p>
<p>A study by the Aberdeen Group showed that companies adopting a “secure at the source” approach to development realized a fourfold return on their application security investments. “The clear takeaway,” the report concludes, “is that application security initiatives of any kind represent extremely good business value.”</p>

<p>Ziteboard is a lightweight whiteboard website which works on any device: laptops, tablets, mobile devices – optimized for both iPad's Safari and Google Chrome on laptops.</p>

<p>The pro features are 9 custom colors, high resolution image insertion. You can import PDF page by page or the whole PDF using the end operator.</p>

The PDF export exports the A4 pages of the infinite working space. If you want to store the whiteboard on your local machine instead of the cloud, export the board as backup file. You can also publish the whiteboard in view only mode, a published board can be view with Ziteboard's viewer.

I also dabble in self-study and have my paws in a lot of STEM-related YouTube channels, so all told, while I have a long way to go in terms of mastering mathematics on a deep level, I certainly feel I have a fair breadth of knowledge ... and probably more interests in various fields of math than I'll be able to deeply pursue in my lifetime.</p>

BS Nguyễn Trọng Nghĩa năm nay đã bước sang tuổi 62, nhưng tinh thần hăng say công việc và ham mê nghiên cứu tìm tòi thì có lẽ vẫn như “mãi mãi tuổi 20”. Suốt gần 30 năm cống hiến với nghề thầy thuốc, có lẽ cuộc đời ông đã viết thành một cuốn nhật ký.</p>

<p>Từ cậu nghiên cứu sinh y khoa đến người thầy tận tâm</p>

<p>Nhận trên tay tấm bằng cử nhân Đh Khoa học năm 1977 cũng là lúc ông bước vào thời gian học tập 4 năm dài tại Đại học Y dược thành phố Hồ Chí Minh.</p>

<p>Năm 1985 xuất sắc trở thành một trong những sinh viên y dược cổ truyền ưu tú, ông được cử đi nghiên cứu sinh tại Học viện Y dược Bắc Kinh, Trung Quốc. Sau 3 năm tìm tòi, nghiên cứu và học tập tại “Cái nôi của nền Đông y cổ truyền  – Trung Hoa”, BS. Nghĩa trở về Việt Nam mang trong mình những khát khao lớn và cái tâm của người thầy thuốc.</p>

<p>Năm 1990 cũng chính là dấu mốc bắt đầu cho “cuộc đời áo trắng” của BS. Nguyễn Trọng Nghĩa khi ông trở về công tác trên cương vị giảng viên Y học cổ truyền tại Đại học Y dược Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh.</p>

<p>Ông chuyển về làm bác sĩ tại bệnh viện Y học cổ truyền TP. Hồ Chí Minh kể từ năm 2001 và luôn luôn giữ được danh hiệu thầy thuốc ưu tú tại đây trong suốt những năm công tác.</p>

<p>An Nam Dược – Bước ngoặt lớn của cuộc đời</p>

<p>Năm 2008, với sứ mệnh đem bài thuốc An Cốt Nam và nhiều phương pháp chữa nhiều bệnh như : trào ngược dạ dày, viêm loét dạ dày, viêm hang vị , đau dạ dày ,… tốt nhất đến tay người bệnh trên khắp cả nước. BS. Nghĩa và đội ngũ ban giám đốc công ty TNHH Tâm Minh Đường đã cùng nhau hợp tác thành lập công ty TNHH Nam An Dược – phòng chẩn trị YHCT An Dược tại khu vực phía Nam.</p>

<p>Ngày hôm nay khi đang giữ chức vụ giám đốc công ty TNHH Nam An Dược và là bác sĩ chuyên môn chính tại YHCT An Dược, PGS. BS. Nguyễn Trọng Nghĩa vẫn đang tiếp tục công cuộc điều trị cho hàng nghìn bệnh nhân ở Tp. Hồ Chí Minh và toàn miền Nam. Đây có lẽ là niềm vui, niềm hạnh phúc mà ông vẫn hằng hướng đến.

This was not, however, because He could not have redeemed us in another way, but so that His surpassing love, manifested hereby, might be a teacher unto us. And by the death of His only begotten Son He made us near to Himself. Yea, if He had had anything more precious, He would have given it to us, so that by it our race might be His own.""</p>

But... my software history and experience is broader than that, going back to '84 when a coworker got tired of his Timex-Sinclair 1000, with membrane ""keyboard"", errorproof ROM BASIC, internal 4K RAM, and the optional 16K memory expansion module... and sold it to me $10. In '85, I started writing software professionally in Turbo Pascal under Digital Research's Concurrent CP/M on S-100 computers with Winchester 10MB hard drives and 8"" floppies.</p>

<p>I wrote a complete common graphics subsystem TSR and complete common windowing UI subsytem TSR in assembly language and tested it with MS BASIC PDS 7, before Microsoft introduced graphical Windows. At the same time, I wrote a structured BASIC (under DOS) multitasking and graphical display software for penitentiary security systems.</p>

<p>(the above occupational profile goes here)</p>

<p>In late 2008, the project I and about 300 other employees were working on was sent to Bangladesh and our office closed; I took the route of becoming an independent contractor, and have been one since that time.</p>

<p>Besides that listed on the occupational profile, I've helped redesign a simple but large MSSQL database, and I've even written one HTML/JavaScript visual-graphical game (including an AutoPlayer for lone users), drawing graphically on the HTML5 canvas; it works fine in Windows with FireFox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari, in Linux with FireFox and Opera, and on Android devices (Kindle &amp; Nook - I don't own an Android phone).</p>

<p>Besides the languages already mentioned, I've written software in QuickBasic, Visual Basic, IRL, and a smattering of Fortran and COBOL. I've built automated Excel tax-calculation spreadsheets, and countless detailed SketchUp 3D models (SketchUp replaced my old favorite, EasyCAD), designed &amp; laid out electronic schematics &amp; circuit boards (my early history was heavy with electronics and hand drafting) with ExpressSCH and ExpressPCB, written a JavaScript minifier, a matching deminifier, and a more simplistic comment stripper with blank-line elimination.</p>

<p>As sidelines, I have a rather respectable woodshop in the barn, three full-sized lathes in the basement, and a small machine shop. I've been gradually rebuilding nearly all of this house (everything except the timberframe and sheathing), including custom cabinetry (cherry &amp; maple solids, heavy maple and Meganite countertops), solid maple strip flooring, and a custom hyperinsulation system I designed. I've replumbed &amp; rewired everything. In what passes for ""spare time"", I like to restore pre-1987 vehicles, specializing in older Jeeps; I have a very good '68 Kaiser M715, an excellent '70 4WD GMC 2500, a '73 Jeep CJ5, a '74 CJ5 Renegade, and an '86 CJ7. I do all my own full disassembly, engine overhauls, rust abatement, body straightening &amp; Bondo, sanding, painting, electrical. I even work on neighbors' older vehicles.</p>

<p>It should be obvious by now that I don't watch TV. 8)</p>

If you are a beginner in a topic, how to avoid asking noob questions? I wonder!!! This reputation point system prevents people to be more friendly. Neutrality is a lie.</p>

<p>The reason I still use it is that it teach me many things, because a lot of rude people, but some very specialized persons can be found here, and there's a lot to learn. It's the (very) positive side. There are some hidden treasures to learn many new things! I learned a lot.</p>

After 6 years of doing manual labor (wood cutting and later roofing) I finally decided, to do what I loved since I found out about it - programming.</p>
<p>(September 2018) I was lucky enough for a company called 8000plus d.o.o. to hire me without any experiences or knowledge, just based on my personality and whom I presented myself as - an enthusiast who will programme with or without them.</p>
<p>(March, 2019) I've gathered loads of experiences in HTML, CSS, PHP and JS, but the more I know, the more I see how clueless I am. As I develop web application I further develop myself and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>(July, 2020) SO. MUCH. TO. LEARN. I've been using ECMAScript6+ for the last half a year, and dropped jQuery completely. Also improving my understanding and usage of Three.js library. PHP-wise I'm adopting the latest versions (currently 7.4) and eagerly awaiting PHP 8. Last but not least mentioning-worth skill I'm improving on is Laravel 6 (with no prior knowledge). Oh, and I keep forgetting my projects in Xamarin.Forms (XAML, C#) - I make them work, but not really sure how. Oops.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll remember to update this description every year.</p>

<p>I started programming videogames in BASIC at 8 years old. This led me to explore Visual Basic and pursue game design. I worked for GoPets doing Q&amp;A &amp; minigame design in Seoul in 2005 and worked as a Game Designer for the leading MMO technology solution, Bigworld Tech in Sydney from 2006-2008.</p>

<p>After returning to the USA, I taught myself iPhone development and became involved in the local Houston iPhone Developer's Meetup. I did third-party app development &amp; entered an all-night coding competition and won with a game developed. From that, leading app development studio ChaiONE offered me a job as a programmer.</p>

<p>I worked there for 2 years before moving to Chattanooga to work with a startup company in the inaugral 2012 Gigtank Startup Accelerator Program sponsored by LaunchTN's CoLab. Since then I have been freelancing iPhone, Android &amp; Backend Server development. I've worked with technologies including GPS, SMS phone services, integrating with credit card processing hardware, federal government app development, non-profit app development, debugging existing server code, leading a game development team, consulting for a software-defined concussion diagnostic tool and more.</p>

<p>Clients include ChaiONE, CoLab, Bluelance, Rice University, Spartan Systems, GS&amp;F.</p>

<p>I am looking for projects related to app development, technical consulting, code reviews, game design &amp; game development. Thank you for your time reading and I look forward to working with you.</p>

<p>My career has started like a lot of other developers, working in a small company without any structure, and creating software in a very rudimentary way. 
After a while working as a developer, my career moved from a full-time employee writing code 8 hours per day, to be an entrepreneur in a small business. However, I was still writing code and delivering software to customers.
This transition provided me a big opportunity to understand other perspectives, the knowledge that most engineers don't have the opportunity to understand when you are exclusively coding, like: 
The impact that the software has directly on people
To understand people frustration and their needs for support
To create empathy for other people, not only customers but also stakeholders
The importance of having a minimal process established to result in more productive work</p>

<p>Later, after a lot of learning and financial problems, I realized my passion was working as a software engineer, despite the fact that I learned a lot during my experience with my own business, this was not what I wanted for my life. 
Thus, I decided to start working as a backend engineer to build a project that would change people's lives: the Serasa eCred (now one of the largest credit marketplaces in Brazil). There I've got the opportunity to support the team to create the product from scratch, working with microservices, PHP, Python, Go, and also being one of the engineers responsible for the third parties integrations.
I had a dream that had not yet been fulfilled, to move abroad. And here I am, living in Berlin and working as a Software Engineer since 2018, working in a squad at Hellofresh that is focused to improve the customer experience in payments, using technologies like Go, Python, Kubernetes, etc.</p>

<p>My background as an entrepreneur has been helping to be successful as a software engineer, because it helps me to understand the background behind the technical decisions and also the impact I might cause to customers, or in other words, to people.</p>

  <p>The act of Programming is indeed thinking. The pure act of Typing is just materializing of what has been thought. Of course, there is a bidirectional feedback connection between writing and thinking. At least for introverts; dunno about extroverts :) And given that, I disagree with @MisterPositive: Of course the typing part needs to be paid, too - a master stone sculptor gets not only paid for planning the sculpture, but also for liberating the sculpture from the stone.</p>

  <p>Many of these fancy web-design fads of the last years may be neat to look at the first few times, be it caroussels, infinite scroll, lazy loading or even (shriek) horizontal layouts, but then they suck from a user's point of view. E.g., with lazy loading one gets different results for incremental search, depending on how much has been scrolled over; crazyness. Also, many of those magick apparatuses destroy conversion rates, something that seems to not exist for a perceived 95%+ majority of webdesigners. Bubble-Bursting read/blog: <a href=""https://crazyegg.com/blog/ugly-website-design"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://crazyegg.com/blog/ugly-website-design</a> .</p>
  
  <p>Also: I really recommend to strike ""why don't they use X, yet"", ""why do they still use X"" and all variants thereof (regex: <code>(still|allready)?.*(use|using).*(yet)?</code>) from your list of idioms. I always get frightened when hearing that, because it's often enough a red flag indicating blind faith in something. ""Yo brother, work for us, we're already using .net, you know"" was something I heard quite often 10 years ago. It sounded like they seriously believed that .net was the One True Thing to use. Know what I mean? My newest favourite acronym fits nicely: <strong><code>A.S.S., Always Stay Skeptical</code></strong>.</p>
